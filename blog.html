        <h1>Why a Disney Themed Website?</h1>
        <p style="max-width: 700px; font-size: 1.1rem">
          I chose to create a Disney-themed website because Disney has been a
          big part of my life ever since I was a kid. The characters, stories,
          and songs have always brought me joy and comfort, and I wanted to
          bring some of that same magic into my project. Building this website
          allowed me to combine my love for Disney with the skills I’ve been
          learning in web development, creating something that feels personal,
          fun, and meaningful.

        <h1>How I Built it</h1>
        <p style="max-width: 700px; font-size: 1.1rem">
          This project was created as part of my coding bootcamp at Uplift Code
          Camp using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a Disney-themed website
          that showcases a wide variety of features, including beloved Disney
          characters, movies, and a music playlist. It also offers a virtual
          Disney park tour and several interactive elements such as character
          quiz and film suggestions. The goal was to create a fun and magical
          online experience inspired by the world of Disney.

          <h1><span class="highlight-red">Step 1:</span> Design & Theme</h1>
          <p>
            I started by designing the website with a playful Disney-inspired
            theme to capture that sense of magic and fun. I used custom fonts
            like <strong>Mali</strong> and <strong>Poppins</strong> to give it a
            whimsical yet clean look, and I chose bright, cheerful colors to
            reflect the joyful energy of Disney. The buttons and icons were
            designed to be cute and engaging, inviting users to explore.

          <h1><span class="highlight-red">Step 2:</span> API Integration</h1>
          <p>
            I used the <code>https://api.disneyapi.dev/</code> to get Disney
            characters. With JavaScript, I filtered the results and displayed
            random characters and their movie titles.

          </h1>
          <p>
            The website includes fun interactive features to keep users engaged.
            One of the main highlights is a “Which Disney Movie Should I Watch?”
            button that randomly suggests a film, perfect for those indecisive
            moments. There’s also a character quiz that lets users discover
            which Disney character they resemble most. To enhance the user
            experience, I implemented loading animations and proper error
            handling to ensure the features work smoothly, even if something
            goes wrong. I also added a fun, animated UI that brings the
            interface to life, making interactions feel more dynamic and
            magical, just like Disney should be.

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 600px">
          I want to keep making the website more fun and interactive. While the
          character quiz currently gives random results, I plan to upgrade it
          soon so the outcome matches the user's answers for a more personalized
          experience. Looking ahead, I’d love to add more interactive features,
          like a “Which Disney Park Should You Visit?” quiz, a mini
          character-matching game, or even a memory card game featuring Disney
          icons. I'm also considering adding a favorites list where users can
          save movies or characters they love. All of these will help make the
          site not just a showcase, but a playful, personalized Disney-inspired
          experience.
